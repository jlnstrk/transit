# transit _[WIP]_

Transit is a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) library for consuming
public transport schedule data from providers.

## Feedback & Contributions

This library is in a very early stage. I'm happy to hear your feedback or design suggestions, just go open an issue!

If you want to contribute, these are the major TODOs right now:

- Finalize an initial interop API
- Add missing HCI services
- Get TRIAS running
  - Set up model generation from XSD as build task
- Better test coverage for API services
- Interop services
- Tests for interop modules
